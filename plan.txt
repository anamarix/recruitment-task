The holidays are usually perfect moment for bigger changes in life. This time the decision was pretty easy. My room needed some attention. Well, attention might be an understatement.
It was more about total renovation than other thing. I planned it really meticulously though. If you have no better things to do at this time of the evening , I will tell you all the details about it.
The big plan:
1.	Write down each and every piece of furniture that needs replacement.
2.	Calculate my budget and see if I can allow myself to buy the furniture in IKEA or if it is a better idea to look on OLX. 
3.	Spend some time online looking for inspiration for the paint color that I will use on my walls.
4.	Make a list of stores in the vicinity where I can find paint, brush and other necessary tools.
5.	Visit the local stores with paper and pencil writting down the prices of the things I need. 
6.	Sum up the costs.
7.	Compare the costs with the budget at my disposal and decide if it is a good idea to finally visit IKEA.
8.	Visit IKEA!
9.	Spend all day window-shopping at Ikea. 
10.	Get a bit depressed because of  inflation!
11.	Go home and spend another 4 hours looking for great deals on OLX.
12.	Check my budget again.
13.	Decide that my room is not yet a total ruin.
14.	Opt for low-budget solution.
15.	Change the color of the walls and buy some flowers for the window sill.
16.	Relax on the sofa.
